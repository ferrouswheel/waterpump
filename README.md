# Wifi Water Pump

This code allows one to control a solar powered water pump using a `Wemos D1 Mini Pro rev 1`.

This is a personal project for [Random Farm](http://randomfarm.nz/), so I don't have to walk to the back of our section to check the pump is running ok!

It monitors water flow with a flow sensor, and will disable the pump if it looks like it has lost prime. It also will monitor
solar and battery voltages, and pump activity.

I'll share a parts catalogue and wiring diagram once I've gotten something working.
